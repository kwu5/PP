# Pyramid Panic

## About the game 

- ***You play an explorer who has become trapped while investigating a large pyramid complex. 
All around lie the treasures of an ancient pharaoh, but pyramids are hazardous places and danger lurks around every corner. 
Deadly scorpions and beetles will block your progress and mummies will hunt you down.
Only by keeping your wits about you can you hope to unravel the secrets of the great pyramid and escape as a rich man.***

- Deep within the center of the pyramid lies its greatest treasure, the **_fabled sword of the sun god Ra_**.
  - It is precious beyond measure, but in taking it you will upset that delicate system and the pyramid will  *be plunged into eerie darkness*. 
  - *Only the small glow* remaining in the sword will light your way now, and formerly simple puzzles will seem new and challenging. 
    
- ***By carrying the sword to the door, you can unlock it and escape from the pyramid.***
  

- **Some wall segments can be pushed, allowing you to reach other areas or hide from enemies.** 
  - Vertical block can only be pushed vertically.
  - Horizontal block can only be pushed horizontally.
  
- **Enemies are clever and will react when they see you to trying to catch you and end your explorations by by  _inreaseing their speed_ .**
  - Beetles only move vertically.
  - Scorpions only move horizontally. 
  - Mummies move in all directions. 
  
 
- The pyramid also contains **_scarabs_** that you can use to make the mummies temporarily vulnerable. **_Potion_** can heal you and gain **_treasure_** will increase your score in-game.
  - When a mummy is chasing you , activing a scarab can *immediately make it flee in opposition direction*.
  
  
- All is not lost, however, for the sword has a second function. 
  - When **wielding the sword** the sword transmutes gold into pure light, lighting your way but reducing your score.
